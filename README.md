## mistakes and errors 
i have made errors on the underestamating the size of the parts and the body its self which has cause me and my teamate to falter in our plans and redo the body aspect twice as well as the lack of time we had either spent on the project and as well as the lack of us getting out plans moving along at points slowing down at some points of doing work but we had also now when pressure was on us we had overcome some of these problems but some still linger like the slowing down of process and the making of the box and printing the body out.
